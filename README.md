# Challenge-13

  ## Title
  ORM



  ## Description
  I built this in order to get a better understanding of how routes work and how they can better be used with models. My motivation was to learn more on how to use insomnia. I learned how to properly use CRUD.



  ## Installation
  first you would install inquirer by typing npm i inquirer in the integrated terminal. then log into mysql and seed the database using node seeds/index.js. 


  ## Usage
  first you would install inquirer by typing npm i inquirer in the integrated terminal. then log into mysql and seed the database using node seeds/index.js. Once all that is done bring up the server by using node server.js. Open insomnia and use CRUD as neccesary to make changes.
